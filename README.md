# Hi folks

### Thanks for visiting my repo, initially called NasaApi which in fact relates to

# Tittle: "NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day."

## The app is just presenting pics from NASA server which are uploaded by NASA each day.

## Important!! Pics are mostly high definition, so depending on the bandwidth it takes a little to download

## The only activity needs to be made is downloading and clicking the next and previous buttons
### App functionality: There is either idea to develop other media type, which actually has been made ('video'). Unnecessary, probably because of iframe selector and thus downloading problems has been postponed (video type is disabled)   
### Technologies: ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
